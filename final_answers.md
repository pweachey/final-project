#Q.1
##There are many similarities and also many differences in our two codes. There are many things that are similar, for example the physics in order to get the planets to revolve around the center axis is the same!! But one thing that you did differently that probably would have been beneficial would have been for me to make a universe file that only stored the simulation file in one ab, I made the mistake of taking a lot of my time in the beginning by just trying to let the universe to work by only having one file, this ultimately in the end isn't the best way to do things.



#Q.2
##Our body files are also very similar in many ways, We initialize all of the needed points, x, y etc and we had to create a def statement that calculates the acceleration, position, and velocity. Something you did differently as well was the ad_froce_from statement, in here you told what the dx and dy was, and how it was going to affect the the planets, and insted of me doing this step in that statement i did it in accy and accy statement, ultimately in the end meaning the same thing.


#Q.3
##You had created a separate universe class making it way easier for you to lay out your code in one other file. Had I done this it might have also been easier to understand and also it would have been easier to solve ultimately in the end. In your universe file you had many statements laid out that made it very easy to read and understand, this would have made it easier for me to solve in the end by not taking so meantime always reading through the code trying to see what it was saying or what it meant. Also in your universe file you had statements like diameter, reset, and forces, this made things easier as well by being able to see the diameter and forces right in front of you. Ultimately in the end I would have liked to create a universe file as well.


#Q.4
##Your code and my code were very different in many different ways. You took the approach knowing what you were doing and you layed out all of the statements and all of the correction conditions first before making sure you code works. I on the other hand had to troubleshoot most of the time by facing with syntax errors and other things truly I didn't understand right away. But when I Got explanation and help from a couple kids in class and my brother, I soon realized it wasn't that hard you just have to  put your mind to it. I would have preferred to have taken your approach into this project just because I think it would have had me a little less stressed, but in the beginning I didn't have all the content necessary to make that happen and I admit to that.


#Q.5
##I will b honest I have many coding weakness, and little strengths. I struggle with understanding what some of what is being taught to understand right Away but it takes time and I soon relize. I understand most of the time what is going on and what is being taught, but putting your brain to it and actually writing the code to work is one of my weakness. I have a strength to be able to troubleshoot sometimes and make things work the last second but that's about it.  This is why i am very happy that I had taken this class for one of many reasons, one ultimately in the end it makes me a way a smarter person and pushes me to make bigger goals in life, as some of the stuff may be very challenging. I believe that next semester I am going to get off to  strong start as at the beginning of this semester I had a ton of golf tournaments during the school day that made me fall behind a little bit, I also know that next semester I am going to be asking a lot more questions and I will speak up when I'm stuck with an issue. I'm happy I took this class and I look forward to next semester Thank you very much.
